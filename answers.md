# Exercise 1 — Two applications meet

## Task 1: Both running, Axios pointed at the real API

The API runs on port 3000 and the frontend on 5173. The API's
`CORS_ORIGIN` is `http://localhost:5173`.

The base URL is in `library-web/.env` as
`VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1`, and `src/api/client.js` reads
it with `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`. I added `.env.example` because
`.env` is git-ignored.

Vite only exposes variables that start with `VITE_`, and it writes their
values into the JavaScript bundle, so anyone can read them in dev tools.
That rules out any secret there (JWT secret, database URL, API keys). Those
stay in the backend's `.env`.
